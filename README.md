  ## Prosperity

  Prosperity is a feature-rich application designed with the following capabilities:

  ### Grid System with Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting

  ![Grid System](https://github.com/danieelbog/Prosperity/assets/54244808/caeccc3e-bc9e-43bc-9639-72b70d2a6f47)

  ### Edit Functionality

  Clicking the edit button inside the grid opens an edit dialog:

  ### Validation and Save Feature

  Title, Latitude, and Longitude fields are validated. Upon correct inputs and detecting changes, the save button is enabled:

  ### Toast Notification and Data Reload

  After saving, a toaster notification appears, and the grid reloads with updated data:

  ## Storybook for presenting components and testing
  Prosperity is utilizing the latest trends, so I created stories, that are used for presentation and testing.

  ## Testing
  There are many unit tests created for my main functions.
  There is accessibility testing for my components.
  There is snapshot tesintg for my components.  
  
  Enjoy exploring Prosperity! ^_^
